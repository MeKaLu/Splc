# A Stupid language experiment, for fun.

This is an experiment for comparing 4 different languages and also a learning project.

The language is nothing serious, not even turing complete. Again, it is for learning and comparing languages.
I am satisfied with just printing text.

The compilers will be written in 4 different languages and the virtual machine that runs the code is
will be written in Nim. Why Nim? It looks fun thats why.

There is 4 different compilers:
  1. in pure x86_64 assembly
  2. in Ada
  3. in Rust
  4. in Zig
